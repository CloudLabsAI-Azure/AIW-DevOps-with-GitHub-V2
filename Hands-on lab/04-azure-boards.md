# Exercise 3: Azure Boards and Test Plans

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you'll explore Azure boards and Azure test plans. Azure Boards provides software development teams with the interactive and customizable tools they need to manage their software projects. Azure Test Plans provide rich and powerful tools everyone in the team can use to drive quality and collaboration throughout the development process. The easy-to-use, browser-based test management solution provides all the capabilities required for planned manual testing.

### Task 1: Connect Azure Board with GitHub

In this task, you will connect your Azure DevOps project's board to your GitHub repository using the Azure Boards app for GitHub to support the integration between Azure Boards and GitHub. This app is free for both public and private repositories. You'll also explore work items.

    ``` 
    https://dev.azure.com/aiw-devops/
    ```

1. In the Azure DevOps page, click on the **User settings** **(1)** from the top right corner of the page and click on **Preview features** **(2)**.
